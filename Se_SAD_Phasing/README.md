# batch.py and parameter.json

This file is used to do batch submission. It connects directly with Se_SAD_automation file. The 'Grid' is formed by this file.
A typical Grid (or say 'tree') of Sulfur SAD will be: /DSUL#/threshold#/resolution#/atom_number#. A typical Grid of Se SAD will be /threshold#/resolution#/atom_number#. 

DSUL will be the disulfide atom within the heavy atom sites. The number is automated by reading the sequence file and count the number of Cystine (C). Highest possible number of disufide atoms are number of C over 2. The totol number of disulfide will be scanned from 1 to the highest possible number. 

Threshold is the cutoff of the occupancy shown in the heavy atom pdb file generated by the SHELXD. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish will is the threshold of the occupancy so that we can drop all the atoms below this threshold. Therefore, we scan a range of threshold to make sure that we are not omitting anything. It is defined to be (0.2 to 0.5)

Resolution is set by inspecting the input reflection file. The highest resoltuion (res) is read and we scan from res to res+1.4 with the interval of 0.1

Atom_number is defined in separated cases. If Selenium (Se) is the anomalous scatterer, highest Se number will be number of methionine (M) in the sequence file. If Sulfur (S) is the anomalous scatterer, highest S number will be number of methionine (M) plus the number of cystine (C). The scan range of both case will be from half of the highest number to the highest number.

Beside these scanned parameters, there are several other defined paramters: minimal distance between atoms (MIND1), minimal distance between symmetry units (MIND2), and highest resolution cutoff. They are determined only on the type of the scatterer. The detailed numbers are in the json file. This json file will be read directly by batch.py.
 
NOTICE: All of the parameters (scanned or fixed) are for SHELXC/D. Crank2 do not take parameters.

MR_phasing stands for Molecular Replacement Automated Phasing Pipeline. It includes the Phenix.MRage and automatically for the grid search for user's defined parameter.

SAD_phasing stands for the Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion Automated Phasing Pipeline with heavy atoms of Selenium (Se) or Sulfur (S). It includes 2 seapareted modules: SHELXC/D, Crank2.
Later the Autobuild refinement will be considered to further refine the protein model.

Examples contain the SAD example of Streptavidin and the MR example of 4N5R which is a lysozyme example.
